# Source Reconstruction Code

This repository contains code for conducting source reconstruction analysis for magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

## Overview

The code in this repository implements a permutation test approach for source reconstruction analysis. The permutation test is used to assess the significance of observed differences in neural sources between conditions or groups.

## Requirements

To use this code, you will need the following dependencies:

- MATLAB and Freesurfer, MNE toolbox, 
- Relevant toolboxes for neuroimaging data analysis (e.g., FieldTrip, SPM)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the directory containing the code.

3. Open the main script file (e.g., `source_reconstruction_analysis.m`) in MATLAB or Octave.

4. Adjust the input parameters and data paths as needed.

5. Run the script to perform source reconstruction analysis and conduct the permutation test.
